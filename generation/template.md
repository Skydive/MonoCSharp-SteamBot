# MonoCSharp-SteamBot
A work in development, to say the least.

Compile using MonoDevelop.
Commands and chat handlers are controlled with IronPython. 
(Because writing them and compiling them in the program doesn't make it very modular).
IronPython also supports C# dlls. (Look at CleverBot)

Setup:
2) Create a new steam account without steam guard
3) Use this.

Note: The username and password can also be used via commandline as the first 2 parameters.
For Instance -> LaunchBot.bat:
cd "C:\Developing\GitHub\MonoCSharp-SteamBot\bin\Debug\"
CS-Mono-SteamBot.exe username password
